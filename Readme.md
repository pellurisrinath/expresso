# Expresso CLI for ExpressVPN

expresso is a command line interface to control the ExpressVPN app. It uses the same native messaging interface as the open-source ExpressVPN browser extension.

# Setup

[Download the latest release here](https://github.com/sttz/expresso/releases). expresso is a self-contained executable and has no dependencies.

Or you can install via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) using [sttz/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/sttz/homebrew-tap), see the tap readme for instructions.


# Alfred Workflow

expresso also comes with an [Alfred](http://alfredapp.com) workflow, which enables to easily choose locations, connect and disconnect from Alfred.

[Download the workflow here](https://github.com/sttz/expresso/releases). The workflow bundles expresso, so you don't need to install anything else.
